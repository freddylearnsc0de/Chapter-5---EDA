    "## The *t* test\n",
    "\n",
    "A *t* test is used to compare the means of two sets of data. For example, in the flanker experiment we used in the [previous section](./repeated_meaasures), we could compare the mean RTs for the congruent and incongruent conditions. *t* tests consider the size of the difference between the means of the two data sets, relative to the variance in each one. The less the distributions of values in the two data sets overlap, the larger the *t* value will tend to be. We can then estimate the probability that the observed difference occurred simply by chance, rather than due to a true difference — this is the *p* value. Typically, researchers use a *p* < .05 threshold to determine statistical significance. \n",
    "\n",
    "*t* tests are implemented in the [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org) library, which \"provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines, such as routines for numerical integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra, and statistics.\" Each of those type of routines is in a separate sub-module of SciPy; the one we'll want is `scipy.stats`.

    "\n",
    "Recall that we are working with repeated-measures data – for each participant, we have 160 trials across 4 conditions. *t* tests are not meant for *within-condition* repeated measures data — we need only one measurement per participant in each condition. This is for essentially the same reason discussed at the end of the previous section on repeated measures data: if we treat the within-participant variability the same as the between-participant variability, then we will tend to grossly under-estimate the true (between-participant) variance. When running a *t* test, this would result in erroneously large *t* values that could often falsely suggest a statistically significant result. So, we need to use the aggregated data, `df_avg`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other important characteristic of our data are that, even though aggregation has reduced the data to one measurement per participant, we still have repeated measures, across the two conditions. The default assumption of a *t* test is that each of the two data sets being compared come from different samples of the population (often called a *between-subjects design* in Psychology). This means that *t* tests assume there is no relationship between any particular measurement in each of the two data sets being compared. When we have measurements from the same people in both data sets (a *within-subjects. design*), we need to account for this, or the *t* test will again suggest an inflated (incorrect) value. We account for this by using a **paired *t* test**. In SciPy, this is the function [`ttest_rel()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html).  (For a between-subjects — or *independent groups* design, which we will not cover here, you would use [`ttest_ind()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html)).\n",

    "### 1-tailed vs. 2-tailed *p* values\n",
    "    \n",
    "By default, SciPy's `ttest_` functions return **2-tailed *p* values**. This means that the *p* value considers both possible directions of difference between the two conditions. In the present example, that means *either* RTs for congruent are faster than incongruent, *or* they are slower for congruent than incongruent. In contrast, a **1-tailed *p* value** should be used if we have a specific prediction of a \"direction\" of the difference. Using a 1-tailed *p* value will tend to be less conservative, i.e., more likely to find a significant effect. This is because, for a given *p* threshold (e.g., $\\alpha = .05$), a 2-tailed test effectively splits the *p* in half, and reflects a probability of 2.5% that the result occurred by chance in one direction (e.g., congruent slower) and a 2.5% probability of getting the reverse result (e.g., congruent faster) by chance. In contrast, a 1-tailed test allocates all of the 5% chance probability to the likelihood of a difference in one direction (e.g., congruent faster).\n",

    "- *t* tests are used to compare the means of two sets of data to each other, or the mean of one set of data against a particular value (such as zero)\n",
    "- An **unpaired *t* test** is used to compare two independent sets of data (e.g., from two different samples of a population, two groups, etc.)\n",
    "- A **paired *t* test** must be used when the two sets of data come from the same samples (e.g., the same individual participants)\n",
    "- A **1-sample *t* test** is used to compare the mean of one set of data against a specific value. This is often used to compare a data set to zero\n",
    "- Paired *t* tests and 1-sample *t* tests can both be used to determine whether differences between two samples are significantly different from zero (no difference). \n",
    "    - In the 1-sample case, you must first compute the difference between the pairs of data in two conditions.\n",
    "- When working with pandas data objects, it is important to remember that SciPy's functions (including `ttest`) do not use pandas indexes. So when doing paired *t* tests, you must ensure that the data are listed in the same order in the two Series being compared.\n",
    "    - The best way to ensure that the within-participant/repeated measures structure of the data is preserved when doing a *t* test, is to use two columns from a DataFrame that is indexed by participant ID.\n",
    "    - One alternative is to use the `.sort_index()` method on two series that are indexed by participant ID\n",
    "    - Another alternative is to use the fact that pandas does respect its indexing when you subtract two Series, so if your data are indexed by participant ID, doing the subtraction followed by a 1-sample *t* test is a way of ensuring that the within-participants relationships between data sets are preserved."
