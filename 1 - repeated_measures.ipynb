    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter on Seaborn plots, we worked with some simulated reaction time (RT) data from 5 individual participants. We showed various Seaborn plots that allowed us to examine the variance in the data sets. However, for the sake of focusing on the different types of Seaborn plots and what they show us, we glossed over one really important aspect of the data — its *nesting structure*, and in particular the fact that we have repeated measures. Repeated measures data are very common in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In fact, while they are often treated as a \"special case\" in statistical and data science texts, in this context we focus on them because most of the data we will encounter later in this course include repeated measures — and **it's very easy to treat the data incorrectly and draw incorrect conclusions if you're not used to working with repeated measures data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the *Thinking About Data for Plotting* lesson, we learned that variance within individual units of measurement (such as individual participants) is not the same as the variance between participants. Furthermore, in a typical experiment our interest is in examining the average effects across individuals, and the range of differences between individuals. When we have nested data, such as many individual trials for each participant, this is because we recognize that any individual measurement may not be accurate, and so by averaging over many measurements we are likely to get a more accurate estimate of the true measurement for each individual. However, if we average the trial-to-trial variance of each individual (which is typically low, within the individual) across individuals, we lose the true inter-individual differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, when plotting nested data it is usually appropriate to first average within each individual (for each condition), and then compute and visualize measures of the true inter-individual variability. Seaborn does not do this by default, and so the plots we generated in the previous lesson were actually inappropriate for assessing whether there was a true experimental effect. In this lesson we'll see how to use pandas `.groupby()` to use Seaborn appropriately with nested data. "

    "### About the data\n",
    "First, let's load in a new data set (`flanker_rt_data.csv`). This is real data from a flanker experiment (similar to that described in the section on [spreadsheets](../2-nds/spreadsheets.html)).  In this experiment, participants had to press either the left or right arrow key, to indicate whether an arrow shown on the screen is pointing left or right, respectively. However, the catch is that the centre arrow is \"flanked\" by two other arrows on each side; these can be pointing the same way as the target arrow (congruent):\n",
    "\n",
    "![flanker_congruent](images/flanker_congruent@0.75x.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "or in the opposite direction (incongruent)\n",
    "\n",
    "![flanker_incongruent](images/flanker_incongruent@0.75x.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that the incongruent condition would be associated with slower RTs, because the flanking arrows create some visual confusion and response competition (cognitive interference; this process is not unlike that underlying the famous [Stroop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) experiment, which you are likely familiar with). In order to confirm this hypothesis, we would want to get an estimate of the RT for each condition, from a representative sample of human participants. We need a number of participants because we know that there is variability in the average RT from person to person (**between-subject** variability). Here we have 27 participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the average RT for each condition for an individual, we would want to present many trials of each condition, in random order. We do this because there is always some trial-to-trial variability in measuring human RTs (**within-subject** variability). In this study each participant completed 40 trials in each condition. Thus we have repeated measures of RT for each participant, in each experimental condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment also had a third condition, *neutral*. On neutral trials, only the centre arrow was presented, without flankers. This condition was included to control for the fact that 5 arrows all pointing in the same direction might facilitate (speed up) responses relative to a single arrow — there might be additive, beneficial effects of congruent flankers. Comparing both the congruent and incongruent conditions to the neutral condition allows us to estimate the relative cost or benefit of flankers that are incongruent or congruent with the direction of the centre arrow. To ensure that there were as many neutral (single-arrow) as flanker (five-arrow) trials, 80 neutral trials were included per participant. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we have data from 27 participants, and approximately 160 trials per participant in total.  The nesting structure of this data set is thus trials (n=160) nested within conditions (n=3) nested within participants (n=27). "

    "The data show the skew that is expected of RT data — there are fundamental human performance limits on how fast a person can respond (short RTs), but the upper limit of RTs is theoretically unlimited. In the present experiment, participants actually only had a 1 s window in which to respond, so the RTs are all less than 1. Nevertheless, the data are skewed because there is a wider range of RTs above the median than below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we can see about the distribution of values is that there are many outliers (individual points in the box plot) at the long end of the RT range, but few at the short end. This is, again, a consequence of the skewed nature of the data. However, notably some of the outliers on the short end of the distributions are suspicious: human RTs in very simple tasks (like pressing a button any time a light comes on) are rarely shorter than 200 ms, yet we have a few RT values below that. So our box plots suggest that we may have some anomalous data, perhaps from trials on which someone pressed a button accidentally prior to processing the actual direction of the arrow.\n",

    "Finally, the box plots suggest that RTs are slowest in the incongruent condition and fastest in the congruent condition — consistent with our predictions based on past studies of the flanker effect.

This suggests that perhaps both facilitation effects in the congruent condition, and interference effects in the incongruent condition, are present in the data. However, it's hard to know how large or believable those differences are, because the distributions overlap quite a bit between the three conditions.\n",

That is, there are few \"fast\" data points, and they are generally quite far from the rest of the distribution of RTs. In contrast, the slower data points are more plentiful, and seem to form a rather continuous set of values, albeit more sparse than the points closer to the centres of the distributions. This suggests that the slower data points might be quite believable as real data — mosly people make faster responses, but sometimes they're a bit slower. In contrast, the strip plot gives us greater confidence that the very fast RTs should be eliminated from analysis, because they are not just slightly-faster responses than the next-fastest responses.\n",

    "### Point plot\n",
    "Finally, let's look at a point plot. Recall that point plots show the mean for each condition, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the measure of variance. CIs are much narrower than the whiskers in box plots, because they are meant to represent our confidence in the estimate of the mean, rather than showing the overall distribution of values. In general, we can interpret conditions with non-overlapping 95% CIs as being \"believably different\" from each other, and likely to be statistically significantly different as well."

This is primarily important in generating plots that show confidence intervals (CIs), such as point plots and bar plots, for reasons explained below.\n",

    "**This is the most important figure in this lesson**. Compared to the point plot with 95% CIs that we generated above for the aggregated data, the CIs in this plot are much larger than those we saw earlier, in the point plot for the un-aggregated data. In that previous plot, the width of the CIs was only about 0.005 s (5 ms). Here, with the CIs computed properly (as reflecting the variance across individuals), the width of the CIs is approximately 0.02 s (20 ms). While still small relative to the differences in the means, the CIs are nonetheless roughly 4x wider in the aggregated data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do CIs get larger when we properly aggregate repeated measures data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen that the variance in the data actually went down, as quantified by the min-max range of values, and the standard deviation. So it may seem strange that the CIs do the opposite, and get bigger. To understand this, consider how the 95% CIs are computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$CI = 1.96 * \\frac{std}{\\sqrt n}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "CIs are computed by dividing the standard deviation ($std$) by the square root of $n$ — the number of data points used to compute the mean and standard deviation. In the un-aggregated data, this was approximately 1000 – 2000 data points for each condition. In contrast, for the aggregated data, $n$ = 27. Thus the CIs are much wider, because dividing by a larger number (1000 - 2000, rather than 27) results in a smaller number (even factoring in the differences in standard deviation, and the square root calculation). The values are multiplied by 1.96 because this is the *z* value corresponding to *p* = .05 in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the conclusions that we would draw from this final plot would be quite different from if we had, in error, used the first point plot generated from the un-aggregated data. The first plot made it look like RTs in the three conditions were very different from each other, with little question as to the differences between them (due to the small and non-overlapping CIs). In contrast, when the data are properly aggregated as in the above plot, the CIs for neutral overlap a lot with both of the flanker conditions, which makes us less confident in their differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the neutral condition was intended to help assess whether the congruent flankers showed facilitation relative to neutral, and whether incongruent flankers showed interference relative to neutral. The fact that the neutral condition overlaps with both others, but congruent and incongruent appear significantly different, suggests that the flanker effect (congruent faster than incongruent) may actually be due to a *combination* of facilitation and interference, rather than one or the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of the current data set is less important here than understanding the importance of recognizing and appropriately dealing with repeated-measures data. It is critical to understand the effects of repeated measures and nesting on estimate of variance — and of the differences between measures of variance in the data (as reflected by things like standard deviation, or box plots), and estimates of our confidence in the accuracy of the mean (CIs). CIs can be used for statistical inference (i.e., is there a believable difference?), whereas the variance reflected in box plots (and histograms, KDEs, etc.) is more informative at the early stages of exploring and understanding your data, and diagnosing potential issues in the data that might need to be addressed prior to inference about the true patterns in the data. Although this initial example used relatively \"clean\" data — and we didn't worry about doing anything to address the skew of the distributions or the outliers — in future lessons we will see cases where this first step can be critically important.
